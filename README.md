# Written-Memories

## Description
In this challenge, we were required to use ExpressJS to use and to modify a Note Taker app in order to allow the end user to jot down and save ideas online. There is also a bonus option to backtrack and redo notes that are not en vogue by the user, which demonstrates the adaptability of the application.

There was starter code already generated, which hints at how the program is to be used regarding gets, posts, uses, and implementation of parsed JSON material.

## Installation
Modified JS scripts for the exercise.

Required the installation of ExpressJS using the CLI command "npm install express".

Provided proper file structure for code and output.

Completed code pushed to GitHub.

Application also deployed to Heroku.

## Usage
The end user will be able to run the application from Heroku and have the ability to modify notes as he or she sees fit.
